A college-town atmosphere permeates this friendly city, home to LSU and Southern, the largest African-American university in the USA.

{"name": "Martha's Vineyard", "description": "Yes, getting there is a bit of a project. But vacationers have been braving the ferry for years, and this tiny island off Cape Cod remains one of the most popular and picturesque destinations in New England.

With stately Greek revival houses dating back to the whaling era of the early 19th century, Edgartown is a seaside village of boutique shopping and pristine harbour views.

Vineyard Haven offers visitors a blend of both. For a real retreat, Chilmark/Aquinnah is the place to get away from it all. In the off-season, the island is quieter and far less crowded, but the shore is always beautiful. Whenever you visit, leave your car behind!

But this historic town on the shores of the Connecticut River is famous for a few other reasons and definitely worth a quick jaunt or weekend away. Springfield was the birthplace and home of beloved children's author and illustrator, Theodore Geisel, Dr. Seuss. In fact, the Zoo in Forest Park, a sure hit with the kids, is said to be the inspiration for many of his wild and wacky tales. Wander through the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden, at the Quadrangle, for a look at the Cat in the Hat and Yertle the Turtle cast in bronze. The city served as a major arsenal during the Revolutionary War, a role that is commemorated at the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, which displays an enormous collection of small pistols.

Landlubbers can take a self-guided hike around the perimeter of the lake, which stretches some 21 miles. Laid-back, however, doesn't mean there isn't plenty to do. Choose from museums, a water park for younger kids, the world's largest refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, entertainment at the Belfry Music Theatre or greyhound racing.

The other major towns are the capital Albuquerque (home of an amazing hot air balloon festival), and the tourist hotspot Santa Fe up in the mountains. Santa Fe is an artistic centre, and there are many museums and galleries to explore, as does nearby Taos. Santa Fe has a lot to recommend it, there's the art scene, the scenic beauty of this city at 7,000 feet, and then there's the diversity of the arts, food and people themselves. It has a very small, compact downtown, which is easy for a family to walk around, and a host of film festivals, art festivals, wine festivals and other special events throughout the year.", "image": "https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/33/fb/06/new-mexico.jpg?w=700&h=500&s=1", "city_list": "United States, New Mexico"}

Ski or snowshoe Brundage Mountain or Tamarack Resorts, as well as Ponderosa State Park in winter. Ice skate year-round at Manchester Ice & Event Centre. About 450 miles north of Boise, there are resort lakes near skiing and golf at Coeur d'Alene, Hayden Lake, and Sandpoint. Golf, tennis, mountain biking, hiking, fishing, rafting, and hunting are popular in Sun Valley and Ketchum. Sockeye salmon may no longer do much spawning in Redfish Lake, but the boating and mountain scenery in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area make the short trip north to Stanley worthwhile. When the snows come the whole family will head for the slopes of Soldier Mountain, Bald Mountain, Dollar Mountain, or the Sun Valley Resort.

A significant player in American history, Lake George is the site of two great forts, Fort William Henry and Fort Ticonderoga, both open to the public. Before plunging into the myriad activities in this family-friendly town, start off with a relaxing lake cruise to learn about the area. Then, take your pick of recreation: parasailing, fishing, diving, jet skiing, hiking, golfing, minigolf, horseback riding and more. If you've got kids in tow, you can't get away without visiting the Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom, New York's largest amusement park. Hikers gravitate to the international trail system or Prospect Mountain, which offers panoramic views from the top; for an easier way up, hop on the tram. Among the cleanest and clearest of major U.S. lakes, Lake George is as splendid today as when Thomas Jefferson described it as \"...without comparison, the most beautiful water I ever saw.\"", "image": "https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/15/4d/46/ff/lake-george.jpg?w=700&h=500&s=1", "city_list": "United States, New York (NY), Lake George"}

Arriving in Cumbria by car, or perhaps hiring a car on your arrival, is virtually essential for seeing the best of what the county has to offer. The Lake District is comprised of around twenty major bodies of water, with a great many smaller ones dotted around. Visitors looking to explore the lakes may be best advised to begin at Windermere and the Brockhole Visitor Centre, where all the required information may be obtained. There are a number of facilities at the centre for all the family to enjoy, including watersports and a children\u2019s adventure playground. Other locations in the area more than worth seeing include Derwent Water, Ullswater and Coniston Water. As well as its Lakeland beauty, Cumbria also has its rugged, mountainous scenery to appreciate. Cumbria is host to every mountain in England over the three thousand feet mark and climbers, adventurous walkers and even mountain bikers are therefore all but spoiled for choice in the locations which they can visit. Cumbria is an area which has witnessed considerable upheaval in a historical sense. Evidence of this dating back to Roman times can still be seen, particularly with the legendary Hadrian\u2019s Wall forming the county\u2019s approximate northern boundary. The path which follows the course of the wall is a great way for walkers with an interest in history to combine both passions. Castles are plentiful in Cumbria, with the impressive Carlisle Castle dating back to Norman times. A visit to Carlisle Castle can be combined with a tour of the historic town, where the ancient features of the county\u2019s main population and economic centre are complemented by the common comforts and conveniences of everyday modern living.", "image": "https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/38/c0/5c/view-of-the-lake-from.jpg?w=700&h=-1&s=1", "city_list": "Europe, United Kingdom (UK), England, Cumbria"}

Visit the El Paso Museum of Art and see American works from the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as Mexican colonial art and retablos from the 1700s and 1800s. Restaurants serve authentic Mexican cuisine, Texas barbecue or a little of both. While this fusion of cultures draws some, the rock climbers who descend on El Paso have only one thing in mind: scaling the massive boulders of Hueco Tanks State Park. Those who prefer the ground can wander through the park's interpretive centre and see ancient Indian pictographs.
